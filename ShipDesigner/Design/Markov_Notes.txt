
	-Weight each input by letter
		- A = 17/256
		- B = 12/256
		- C = 5/256 
		- etc.


	ORDER OF OPERATIONS 
		- Determine first letter on probability of beginning letters
		- Determine subsequent letters on probability of letters before it
		- Determine whitespace probability
		- Determine second word probability 


	- Determine first letter based on weighted probability
		- "A" 

	- Determine probability of next letter
		- A -> A = 0
		- A -> B = .01
		- A -> C = .01 
	- Choose letter based on weighted probability
	- Handling case of no probabilities
		- Remove first letter from determiniation until probability can be established; continue removing index 0 until probability can be established


	- Determine probability of next letter based on last two
		- AU -> A = 0
		- AU -> B = 0.01
		- AU -> C = 0.17
	- Choose letter based on weighted probability

	- Continue choosing letters until whitespace chosen 
		- To determine whitespace probability:
			- Determine length of input names 
			- 4 letters = 7/256
			- 5 letters = 125/256
			- 6 letters = 32/256
